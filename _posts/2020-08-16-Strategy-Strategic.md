**Content is like a movie. It should display emotion, action, friendship, love, and above all, it should have a story, albeit an interesting one.**

Of late, I'm hearing a lot about the content strategy and its effectiveness in dealing with many content problems (for example, content accuracy, reuse, visualization, or minimalism). Content strategists often present content strategy as a medicine for all the content related problems. But, does a content strategy, howsoever effective, is "the remedy" to all the ills ailing the content industry?

Before I talk about my problems with the content strategy and its outcome, let's first understand what content strategy is.  

### What is content strategy?

There are many pillars on which content strategy stands, out of that main pillars are:

 - Content placement
 - Content reuse
 - Content delivery
 - Content tracking
 - Ease of navigation
 - Ease of search
 - Micro-content (same as micro-APIs)
 - Content Marketing and lead generation

Content strategists connect these pillars with a tie-beam, that is, a Content management system.
And here lies the problem!

### The Problem

All the content strategists base their webinars, meetings, and articles on the assumption that whatever they are offering is correct, and it's precisely what the client wants. The confidence with which they talk about content strategy makes me nervous.

**Strategy without data analysis is like butter chicken without chicken.**

Deep down, I always think, where they are getting the data to back their claims. Did they talk to their clients individually, in a town hall, or clients tell them about their needs? What is the source?

### Not The End

I thought this must be it. But slowly I realized that content strategists are not only building castles in the air, but they are also offering strategies offered by other top-line companies as their own.

**They call it innovation when, in reality, it's renovation.**

The problem with this kind of approach is that you can never be sure that the things which are working for others will work for you as well (due to differences in the work domain). That's why I'm an advocate of strategic content.

### What is strategic content?

Understand it this way, if you are thirsty, would you want water or food? More importantly, how do you know that you are thirsty?

There's only one answer to all the above questions - you need to talk to your clients and prepare a common ground. You've to understand what their real requirements are. What all enhancements they want in your content. Only then you can develop a strategy that is your own, based on your work domain.

**Innovation without understanding the real requirement is like watering a plant that you somehow planted on a hilltop.**

After all, the tie-beam should be clients, not some content management system, which is a separate ball game together.
