<h4> Tell me about your education? </h4>

<p>After completing my schooling from Army School, MHOW (MP), I did what a typical Indian middle-class student would do, <b>Engineering</b>. After earning my degree in Electronics and communication domain (June 2011), I realized that this is not what I desired. With almost zero knowledge of any programming language, electronics, or communication, I sat my foot out in the job market. It just took a couple of rejections before I thought about quitting. I'm sure you can understand the frustration of a graduate who is not getting a job. In between, I also thought about joining call centers as well. But somehow that plan never materialize. Suddenly out of nowhere, one day, I got a call from NIIT (August 2011), following which I never looked back.</p>

<h4>Engineering and then technical writing, I'm confused? </h4>

<p>Well, I'm confused till date :) Jokes apart, I did not know any programming language, neither I was too proficient in electronics. It was my mother's grace that I landed up with a job in Technical Writing.</p>


<h4>Do you have a personal life?</h4>
<p>Oh Yes, I'm married and have a child.</p>
